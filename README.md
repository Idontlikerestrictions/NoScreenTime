 NoScreenTime - a .mobileconfig file for disabling screen time on IOS

*Device MUST be supervised (use nugget or cowabunga lite)*

To use:
-Download the zip and save to files
-Uncompress the zip
-Click on the no screen time file - it should ask if you want to download the profile and to review it in settings
-Then go to settings to approve and install the files (it will give warning due to it being an unsigned profile)

All the other config files in there are just for personal use.
